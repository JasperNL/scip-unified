Notes for SCIP Release 2.1


Features
========

- Major extensions for nonlinear CIP
  + New constraint handlers for absolute power constraints, 
    nonlinear equations with algebraic expressions (only Beta), 
    and for bivariate nonlinear constraints (only Beta)
  + Reformulation, domain propagation, and convexity check supported by expression graph
  + Improved pseudocost branching on continuous variables
  + New interval arithmetic functions

- New funtionalities in the interactive shell (modify current CIP instance, store NLP relaxation)

- In branch-and-price algorithms, created variables can now be deleted (beta version)

- New constraint handlers for pseudoboolean and disjunction constraints

- New primal heuristics (LNS heuristics employing variable bounds and clique partitions)

- New original solution storage capability, which allows sharing solutions between SCIP runs

- New separator for close cuts including a function to compute relative interior points

- New presolving steps for various constraint handlers 

- Propagators are now also called in node presolving

- Extended support of lazy bounds

- New targets "(un)install" in Makefile, support for valgrind in testing environment, 
  threadsafe compilation possible (only with CPLEX as LP solver)


Interfaces
==========

- Improved SOPLEX interface (LP simplifier, bound flipping ratio test)

- Improved CPLEX interface, including measures for numerical stability

- New scripts for running tests with GAMS

- New reader for (standard) bounds on variables 

- Support of GML format for storing the variable bound graph

- Improved support for wbo format for weighted PBO problems, IBM's xml-solution
  format, and pip format for polynomial mixed-integer programs

- Extended reader for Flatzinc models to handle cumulative constraints

- Extended reader for CIP models to handle various new constraints

- Extended readers for GAMS and pip models to write additional nonlinear constraints 



Performance Improvements and Bug Fixes
======================================

- Improved LNS and undercover heuristics

- Improved knapsack cover cuts 

- Reorganized filtering process of separation storage (allows adding cuts for different solutions)

- Improved propagation methods for variable bound constraints

- More robust sorting functions 

- Many bug fixes


Additional Notes
================

- The display of statistics for presolvers, propagators, constraints and LP
  solving has changed. For details see the CHANGELOG file.

- The interface contains several additional callback functions and
  parameters for plugins. Some effort may be required to compile your
  old projects with SCIP 2.1. For details see the CHANGELOG file. See
  also "Changes between version 2.0 and 2.1" in the doxygen
  documentation for additional information.
