Notes for SCIP Release 2.0


Features
========

- SCIP can now copy instances (e.g. for heuristics).

- New rounding and propagation heuristics, rapid learning

- Preliminary support of domain holes

- New constraint handlers for linking constraints, cumulative constraints,
  and for breaking orbitopal symmetries

- New separators for oddcycle cuts and Chvatal-Gomory cuts using sub-MIPs

- Solution counting extended to MIPs

- Better support for non-convex MIQPs and MIQCPs:
  + Improved constraint handler for quadratic constraints
  + support of quadratic extensions in file formats .lp and .mps
  + New constraint handler for second order cone constraints
  + new MINLP heuristics
  + automatic branching on solutions of arbitrary relaxations and on continuous variables
  + preliminary support for non-linear relaxations (via expression trees)


Interfaces
==========

- Improved SoPlex interface

- NLP solver interface (NLPI) now independent of SCIP like LPI

- Enhanced user interface for callable library: manual restarts,
  predefined settings, and many other features

- Support of wbo format for weighted PBO problems, IBM's xml-solution
  format, and pip format for polynomial mixed-integer programs

- Extended reader for Flatzinc models

- Extended reader for .lp and .mps files for semicontinuous variables




Performance Improvements and Bug Fixes
======================================

- Several improvements in presolving

- Enhanced handling of indicator constraints

- Improved zerohalf cuts

- Many bug fixes




Additional Notes
================

- A bug in the Makefiles of older versions of the SCIP examples may cause
  data loss. If you have a custom Makefile, please ensure that the target
  "clean" is changed as described here:
  http://scip.zib.de/download/bugfixes/scip-1.2.0/make.txt.

- The additional NLPI library requires a change in the Makefile of SCIP's project:
  The $(MAINFILE) target now has $(NLPILIBFILE) as additional dependency and the linking
  command requires $(LINKCXX_l)$(NLPILIB)$(LINKLIBSUFFIX) as additional argument.

- The interface contains several additional callback functions and
  parameters for plugins. Some work might be required to compile your
  own projects with SCIP 2.0. For details see the CHANGELOG file. See
  also "Changes between version 1.2 and 2.0" in the doxygen
  documentation for additional information.
