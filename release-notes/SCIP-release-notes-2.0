Notes for SCIP Release 2.0


Features
========

- Full support of non-convex MIQPs and MIQCPs: Improved constraint handler
  for quadratic constraints, new constraint handler for second order cone
  constraints, new MINLP heuristics, automatic branching on solutions of
  arbitrary relaxations, branching of continuous variables, improved
  handling of non-linear relaxations (expression trees), support of various
  file formats

- New constraint handlers for linking constraints, cumulative constraints,
  and for breaking orbitopal symmetries

- New rounding and propagation heuristics and rapid learning

- New separators for Chvatal-Gomory cuts using sub-MIPs and oddcycle cuts

- Preliminary version of copying SCIP instances

- Preliminary support of domain holes

- Solution counting extended to MIPs


Interfaces
==========

- Improved SoPlex interface

- NLP interface now independent of SCIP like LPI

- Enhanced user interface for callable library: manual restarts and
  predefined settings

- Test scripts for Gurobi, BLIS, Symphony, and GLPK

- Support of wbo format for weighted PBO problems and IBM's xml-solution
  format

- Extended reader for Flatzinc models


Performance Improvements and Bug Fixes
======================================

- Several improvements in presolving

- Enhanced handling of indicator constraints

- Improved zerohalf cuts

- Many bug fixes


Additional Note
===============

- A bug in the Makefiles of older versions of the SCIP examples may cause
  data loss. If you have a custom Makefile, please ensure that the target
  "clean" is changed as described here:
  http://scip.zib.de/download/bugfixes/scip-1.2.0/make.txt.


For details see the CHANGELOG file. Some of the interface functions were
changed. See "Changes between version 1.2 and 2.0" in the doxygen
documentation for additional information.
